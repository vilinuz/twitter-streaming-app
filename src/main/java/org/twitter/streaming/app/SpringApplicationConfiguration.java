    // as the beans they referred to are either managed by component scan or removed.

    // TwitterConfig is a @ConfigurationProperties bean, automatically registered.
    // TwitterStatusThreshold has been removed.
    // ReactiveTwitterService, TweetProcessingService, TwitterStatusesJsonCreator are @Service/@Component,
    // found by component scan.
    // OAuthAuthorization is a @Bean within TwitterConfig.

    // This class can be kept if other general @Bean definitions are needed in the future,
    // or it can be removed if @SpringBootApplication's component scan and @Configuration classes
    // like TwitterConfig cover all bean definitions.
    // For now, leaving it as is (empty or with comments) as a placeholder for potential future shared beans.
    // If no such beans are envisioned, this file could also be deleted.
